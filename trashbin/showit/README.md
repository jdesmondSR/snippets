showit
======

**Deprecated**. Not functional.

I want a tool to show log of a backgroud process (e.x. python goagent/local/proxy.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &), this is why I want to write showit.  
But I stopped coding right after I found this "[Redirecting Output from a Running Process](http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/02/27/redirecting-output-from-a-running-process/)".
